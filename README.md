### NLP-Suite-Models

This repo contains the code to train different NLP models which will be used in my final year project named **NLP-Suite**.

#### Instructions

1. Create virtual enviroment either using python or conda for the model that you want to run.
2. The file `requirements.txt` contains the required libraries to be installed to work.
3. Data used to train models should always be located in `data/` folder.
   - For e.g. `sentiment-analysis/data/`
4. Read further instruction in `README.md` files located in each folder.
